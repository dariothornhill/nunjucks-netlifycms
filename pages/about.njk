                    <p class="lead">At IMORO we invite you to indulge in our heritage, Caribbean history and folklore of our ancestorâ€™s way of using remedial ingredients from land and sea to naturally soothe and benefit the body. Fast forward to today where we at IMORO capture some of these elements in our award-winning line of Body and Spa products.</p>
                    <p>Rich body butters, emulsifying scrubs, luxurious skin oils, masks and pain-relieving jellies incorporate local and regional botanicals, trace minerals and other sustainably source raw ingredients to create our natural products and Spa treats.</p>
                    <p>After our initial launch in April 2015, which focus more on the professional side of the business we have since expanded our line to our loyal customers to take the Spa experience home with them. Our extensive offerings cater to both male and female of all ages. (see our product listing for more) We will continue to add to our line as we research and develop new products.</p>
